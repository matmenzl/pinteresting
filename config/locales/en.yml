# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

Nothing else. Either if you look for a garden hose or a cat sitter, or if you look for jogging-mates. Everything is possible here."
    caption2title: "Closed Network"
    caption2text: "The adress you register with gives you immediate access to your neighbourhood. Only users within your neighbourhood can see your offers/requests. No worries: Uses who register with the wrong adress can't do you any harm. Your information stays private until you connect with your neighbour. If you don't know someone who contacts you, just ignore it if you want."
    caption3title: "Environment"
    caption3text: "You probably know a lot of websites for exchanging items and renting stuff. But all act as if you had a car and plenty of time getting things from place A to B and back. But they neglect, that this needs time, money and is actually not at all environmentally sustainable. meetyourstreet.ch fills this gap because you see what your neighbours sell, rent or need and look for. You can help out and get help and assistance."
    caption4title: "Easy & happy"
    caption4text: "It really makes your life easier when you know your neighbours and can get things done quickly. It makes you happier when you get to know who lives nearby in the same street. It's a good thing when neighbours meet and help each other out. It bonds your neighbourhood and your live gets better."

    caption3: "In neighbourhoods safety and privacy is important. So be thoughtful what you post online and behave. Connect with your real name and adress, otherwise your neighbours won't recognize you (you wouldn't walk around your neighbourhood with a basket on your head, unless you want to robb a bank, right?)"
